# `Necessity`: a three-valued Kleene modality

Three-valued modality tracking whether a property holds `always`, `possibly`, or
`never`.

`Necessity` is the three-element Kleene chain `never < possibly < always`, and
`neg` (written `~a`) is the order-reversing involution that fixes `possibly`. That
makes `(Necessity, ⊔, ⊓, ~)` a **Kleene algebra** (De Morgan algebra + Kleene
condition), *not* a Boolean algebra: the complement law `a ⊓ ~a = ⊥` fails at
`possibly`. Hence the operation is named `neg`, not `complement` — the lemmas
below pin down what it actually is.
